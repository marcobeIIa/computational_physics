file content:

 - Metropolis. {ipynb,py} - main notebook, contains all data analysis

 - libraryMetropolis.py - contains all the code for kinetic energy calculation, as well as metropolis algorithm functions

 - man_vs_machine.{ipynb,py} - contains consistency checks between the various analytical calculations here used (for the kinetic energy) and finite-difference approximations

 - phi.py - contains an alternative way of computing the wavefunctions

 - wf_check. {ipynb,py} - checks consistency between the two approaches to building wavefunctions

 - ex4.pdf - is the assignment

All the jupyter notebooks are paired to a python file carrying the same name via the JupyText extension. This is because git does not like jupyter notebooks, especially when doing version control.
